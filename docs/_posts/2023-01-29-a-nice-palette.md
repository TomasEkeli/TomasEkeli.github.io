Quite often I find myself needing some colours for something – it might be a graphic, it might be to call out something in a presentation, whatever.

Usually I just pick a colour, maybe from the colour-palette of the company I’m working for, and try to pick some complementary colours – or at least something that doesn’t look horrible.

I just saw a post by [kate@fosstodon.org](https://fosstodon.org/@kate/109348023789472321) where she announced a very nice [12-bit rainbow palette](https://iamkate.com/data/12-bit-rainbow/) for just this kind of work. Wonderful!

I will try to remember it the next time I need some colours!
