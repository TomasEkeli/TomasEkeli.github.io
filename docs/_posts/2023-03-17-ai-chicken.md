My wife asked me to come up with something for dinner today, and the lack of inspiration lead me to ask [#ChatGPT](https://www.eke.li/tag/chatgpt/).

And the AI delivered! I do not know if this is a recipe it’s stolen from somewhere or if it just made up likely-sounding ingredients and steps, but it actually worked. We made it, and it’s pretty good!

It chose a chicken-pasta with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes. The dish was very tasty, perhaps i’d use slightly less sun-dried tomatoes and add some nice mustard or something to give the sauce a bit of a kick – but, it worked as a dish.

Here is the creamy chicken pasta with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes recipe translated into English:

## Creamy chicken pasta with spinach and sun-dried tomatoes

### Ingredients:

- 14 oz (400 g) pasta (e.g. penne or fettuccine)
- 2 chicken breasts, cut into pieces
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 3.5 oz (100 g) sun-dried tomatoes, cut into strips
- 7 oz (200 g) fresh spinach
- 1 cup (250 ml) heavy cream
- 3.5 oz (100 g) grated Parmesan
- Fresh basil, chopped (optional)

### Instructions:

1. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Season the chicken pieces with salt and pepper, and cook them in the oil until they are cooked through and golden. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.
3. In the same frying pan, add more oil if necessary, and cook the onion and garlic until the onion is soft and translucent. Add the sun-dried tomatoes and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
4. Add the spinach to the pan and stir until it wilts and is still green.
5. Pour in the heavy cream and let it simmer for a few minutes. Stir in the grated Parmesan and allow the sauce to thicken slightly. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.
6. Add the cooked chicken back to the pan and stir to coat it in the sauce. Let it cook together for 2-3 minutes.
7. Mix in the cooked pasta and stir well, ensuring the pasta is well-coated in the sauce.
8. Serve the creamy chicken pasta with a sprinkle of fresh basil, if desired. Serve with a fresh salad and some bread on the side for a complete meal.

Enjoy this delicious creamy chicken pasta for dinner today!
