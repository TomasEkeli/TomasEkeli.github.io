Tired of constantly switching between the terminal and your code editor while working on your .NET projects? I am. Today I‚Äôll show you how to configure Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with .NET to run tests, watch for changes, and run ASP.NET Core projects.

We will set up your `tasks.json` file to create custom tasks for building, testing, and running your projects.

### Create a Build Task

First, we‚Äôll create a [task](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/tasks) to build our solution. To do this, add the following task configuration to your `tasks.json` file:

```json
{
	"label": "build",
	"command": "dotnet",
	"type": "process",
	"group": "build",
	"args": [
		"build",
		"${workspaceFolder}/YourSolution.sln",
		"/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
		"/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary"
	],
	"problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
}

```

This task will build your .NET solution (replace ‚ÄúYourSolution‚Äù with your solution‚Äôs name) and report any compilation issues to the problems panel in VSCode.

This task uses the built-in `$msCompile` problem-matcher. It is fine for normal builds, but for watches and tests we‚Äôll have to dive a bit deeper, as we‚Äôll get to..

### Configure Tasks for Running Tests

Now let‚Äôs set up tasks to run our tests. We‚Äôll start by creating a task to run all tests in the solution:

```json
{
	"label": "test",
	"command": "dotnet",
	"type": "process",
	"group": "test",
	"presentation": {
		"reveal": "silent",
		"panel": "dedicated",
		"close": true,
		"group": "tests",
		"focus": false,
		"clear": true,
		"echo": false,
		"revealProblems": "onProblem",
		"showReuseMessage": false,
	},
	"args": [
		"test",
		"${workspaceFolder}/YourSolution.sln",
		"--nologo",
		"/property:GenerateFullPaths=true",
		"/consoleloggerparameters:NoSummary"
	],
	"problemMatcher": {
		"owner": "tests",
		"fileLocation": "absolute",
		"pattern": [
			{
				"regexp": "^\\s*at (?:[^.]+\\.)+([^()]+)\\(\\) in (.*):line (\\d+)$",
				"message": 1,
				"file": 2,
				"line": 3,
			}
		]
	}
}
```

This task runs all tests within your solution and displays the output in a dedicated panel. I‚Äôm using [XUnit](https://xunit.net/), so my problem-matcher is custom for how that logs test-failures.

The task runs `dotnet test` on the solution in the workspace -root, that should run all the tests if you‚Äôve been good and added all your test-projects to the solution.

The `presentation` property is all about customizing how the task output appears in the integrated terminal. It lets you control when the terminal pops up, which panel to use, and how the output is displayed.

The `problemMatcher` property helps you catch problems (errors or warnings) in the output. It uses patterns to identify issues and then displays them in the ‚ÄúProblems‚Äù panel of VSCode. This makes it easier to spot and fix any issues that come up during testing. This is the part that causes red squigglies in your code!

In this example, the `problemMatcher` is tailored for XUnit test failures, but you can customize it for your preferred testing framework. This one looks for lines from stack-traces and picks out the file, line-number and just uses the last part of the caller (which should be the test-method) as the message. [Regexen are fun!](https://regex101.com/)

Next, we‚Äôll create tasks to watch individual test projects for changes and re-run the affected tests automatically. Add the following task configuration for each test project (if you are like me you probably have a few):

```jsonc
{
	"label": "watch YourTestProject.Tests",
	"command": "dotnet",
	"type": "process",
	"group": "test",
	"presentation": {
		"reveal": "silent",
		"panel": "dedicated",
		"close": true,
		"group": "tests",
		"focus": false,
		"clear": true,
		"echo": false,
		"revealProblems": "onProblem",
		"showReuseMessage": false,
	},
	"isBackground": true,
	"options": {
		"cwd": "${workspaceFolder}/Specifications/YourTestProject.Tests"
	},
	"args": [
		"watch",
		"test",
		// maybe ignore integration tests or something
	],
	"problemMatcher": {
		"owner": "Hosting.Tests",
		"fileLocation": "absolute",
		"pattern": {
			"regexp": "^\\s*at (?:[^.]+\\.)+([^()]+)\\(\\) in (.*):line (\\d+)$",
			"message": 1,
			"file": 2,
			"line": 3,
		},
		"background": {
			"activeOnStart": true,
			"beginsPattern": "Started",
			"endsPattern": "Waiting for a file to change"
		}
	}
}
```

Replace ‚ÄúYourTestProject‚Äù with the actual name of your test project. These tasks will monitor your test projects and re-run tests whenever a file changes.

So, we‚Äôve already got a task set up to run all our tests, but now we want to make it even better by continually running tests on a watch. The `dotnet watch` program does not support watching a whole solution, so you‚Äôll have to set a task up per test-project.

Setting this up is helpful because it shortens that [red-green-refactor](https://dzone.com/articles/pattern-of-the-month-red-green-refactor) cycle, making you more efficient, happy and keeping your code neat and tidy.

How does it work?

The `isBackground` property is crucial By setting it to `true`, you‚Äôre telling VSCode that this task will keep running in the background. The problem-matcher will keep running and update VSCode with problems (adding and removing) when it sees their state change. This means you can continue coding without any interruptions while the tests run in the background. Pretty cool, right?

Now let‚Äôs dive into the `background` part of the `problemMatcher`. It‚Äôs all about tracking the beginning and ending of your background tasks. With `activeOnStart: true`, the problem matcher starts monitoring right away. The `beginsPattern` and `endsPattern` properties are used to identify when the task starts and ends. Your log will contain parts that aren‚Äôt interesting to the problem-matcher, so you want it to start when problems might appear. You also want it to know when it can end its lookout and tell VSCode what it‚Äôs found. With these two defined and the `isBackground` on your squigglies will appear and (hopefully more often) disappear as you code! Wonderful!

Combining the `isBackground` property and the `background` part of the `problemMatcher`, you get this magical synergy where your tests run continuously in the background. Your code editor highlights any issues directly in your code, so you can fix them on-the-fly. This way, you‚Äôre always on top of your game, catching bugs early and keeping your code in tip-top shape.

Imagine the time we‚Äôll save! No more manual test runs every time you make a change. Just code away, and let the watch tasks handle the testing. This will make your development process smoother and help you create more reliable code with fewer hiccups. Nirvana.

### Run the ASP.NET Core Project with Watch

Alright, now let‚Äôs make our lives even easier by setting up a watch to run our ASP.NET Core project. This way, we can see our changes in action without having to restart the project manually every time. So let‚Äôs dive in!

```jsonc
{
	"label": "Run YourProject",
	"command": "dotnet",
	"dependsOn": [
		"maybe a docker compose or something?"
	],
	"group": "none",
	"isBackground": true,
	"detail": "Use this to run YourProject on http://localhost:YourPort",
	"presentation": {
		"echo": true,
		"reveal": "always",
		"focus": false,
		"panel": "shared",
		"showReuseMessage": true,
		"clear": false
	},
	"type": "process",
	"args": [
		"watch",
		"run",
		"--configuration",
		"LocalDev", // note this one
		"--project",
		"${workspaceFolder}/path/to/your/web.csproj"
	],
	"problemMatcher": {
		"owner": "csharp",
		"source": "msCompile",
		"applyTo": "closedDocuments",
		"fileLocation": "absolute",
		"pattern": {
			"regexp": "^(.*)\\((\\d+),(\\d+)\\):\\s+(error|warning|info)\\s+([A-Za-z0-9_]+)\\s*:\\s*(.*)$",
			"file": 1,
			"line": 2,
			"column": 3,
			"severity": 4,
			"code": 5,
			"message": 6
		},
		"background": {
			"activeOnStart": true,
			"beginsPattern": "^dotnet watch üöÄ Started$",
			"endsPattern": "^(The build failed|Starting up)"
		}
	}
}
```

Again, replace ‚ÄúYourProject‚Äù with the name of your project.

The task configuration for ‚ÄúRun YourProject‚Äù includes a non-standard configuration (`"LocalDev"`). This is super helpful because it prevents your watch task from interfering with locked files, like those pesky running tests. Neat, huh? Just remember to replace ‚ÄúYourProject‚Äù with the actual name of your project.

Now, you might be wondering, ‚ÄúHey, what about that `$msCompile` problem matcher? Can I use it here?‚Äù Well, my friend, the default `$msCompile` problem matcher doesn‚Äôt play well with watches. But don‚Äôt worry! We‚Äôve got a custom problem matcher with a `background` part, similar to the test-watch task we discussed earlier. This one works like a charm with watches and will keep your project running smoothly.

So, with this new task in place, your ASP.NET Core project will start up and automatically restart whenever you make changes to your files. No more tedious manual restarts! Just focus on your code, and let the watch task handle the rest.

You‚Äôre now all set up to code like a pro, with your tests and project running in the background, watching for changes and keeping you on track. Enjoy the boost in productivity and the joy of seamless development!

### Run all the tasks!

Wrapping up, we can make our lives even more convenient by creating a task that runs all watch tasks simultaneously. This nifty trick will save you time and keep your workflow smooth.

```jsonc
{
  "label": "run all the watch tasks",
  //...
  "dependsOn": [
	"watch YourTestProject1.Tests",
	"watch YourTestProject2.Tests",
   ],
	"presentation": {
		"reveal": "never",
		"focus": false,
		"panel": "shared",
		"showReuseMessage": false,
		"clear": false
	},
	"type": "shell",
	"problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
}

```

The ‚Äúrun all the watch tasks‚Äù configuration simply depends on all your test project watch tasks, like ‚Äúwatch YourTestProject1.Tests‚Äù and ‚Äúwatch YourTestProject2.Tests‚Äù. Just make sure to include all your test projects in the `dependsOn` array. With this setup, you can kick off all your watch tasks in one go, allowing you to focus on what matters most: writing awesome code!

If you have more than one test-project you‚Äôll also now see why we might not actually always want to run all of them at once. I have about 10 such projects in my current VSCode, and spinning them all up certainly heats up the room. Which can be nice if my fingers are getting cold.

Once they‚Äôre all running they will discover any changes and start over, so if you‚Äôre working in a project that‚Äôs used by many other projects you can really enjoy the warmth and noise.

Personally I usually run all the test-projects before i push something, but when coding I often have just one or two of the most likely to break test-watch tasks running.

### **Bonus: Clean Task**

It‚Äôs can be nice to clean your solution periodically, which helps maintain a clutter-free development environment. For this purpose, here‚Äôs a ‚Äúclean‚Äù task:

```jsonc
{
	"label": "clean",
	"command": "dotnet",
	"type": "process",
	"args": [
		"clean",
		"${workspaceFolder}/YourSolution.sln",
		"-v",
		"q"
	],
	"problemMatcher": "$msCompile"
}
```

This task uses the `dotnet clean` command to clean the solution, ensuring that old build artifacts are removed. If you do end up with locked files ‚Äì this one will remove them.

### Wrapping Up

You now have a complete set of tasks for building, running tests, watching tests, hosting your ASP.NET Core project with watch, and cleaning your solution! By utilizing these tasks, you will improve your development experience and efficiency.

Hopefully these tasks will get you on the path to quick feedback from your tests and smooth running. Customize the tasks as needed for your specific projects!

_Happy coding!_
