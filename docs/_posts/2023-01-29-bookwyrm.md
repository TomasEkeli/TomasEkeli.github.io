I wouldn’t call myself a voracious reader of books, but I do like to read. I’ve been using [BookWyrm](https://bookwyrm.social/) lately, to track my reading and what I want to read.

It’s a social site that supports [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) and centers on reading and books. This means other sites (like, for example, Mastodon) can interact with content on BookWyrm. Yes, you can follow [my BookWyrm -account](https://bookwyrm.social/user/TomasEkeli) from your [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) \-account, which is neat. For me it replaces [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/), which I don’t quite trust.

You can sign up to [an instance](https://joinbookwyrm.com/instances/) and start tracking your reading progress and goals, and write book-reviews and comments.

Quite nice, I like it, I only wish there was a “Norwegian” -instance. I don’t read a lot of Norwegian books, but some and they are probably irrelevant to people of other languages.

But I’m not going to set one up myself, am I?
