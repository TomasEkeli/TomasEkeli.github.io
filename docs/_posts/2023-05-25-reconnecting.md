I was at the [NDC conference in Oslo](https://ndcoslo.com/) this week, and happened to meet up with an old colleague and friend of mine, John.

We chatted, and geeked out, and ended up talking about old computers. I mentioned that my first computer was a [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) (the bread-box). And he told me that he still has his (I don’t), and he’s actually making stuff for it!

One thing led to another, and he showed me how to program a C64 -emulator with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSCode)! Definitely a fun thing I want to play with!

Here are some links he shared with me:

[ACID64](https://acid64.com/): a C64 music-player designed for playing SID -tunes (the famous sound-chip on the C64 was the [6581 SID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581) -chip, Sound Interface Device)

[VICE-emu](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/): C64 emulator, for those of us who are currently (temporarily) without C64 hardware.

[C64 Debugger](https://github.com/sunsided/c64-debugger): an actual debugger for the VICE emulator!

[CSDb](https://csdb.dk/): most (all?) of the demos released on the C64 – there are **a lot.**

Finally – [Kick Assembler 8-Bit Retro Studio](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulhocker.kick-assembler-vscode-ext): a VSCode extension to build programs with the [Kick Assembler](http://www.theweb.dk/KickAssembler/Main.html#frontpage).

I haven’t programmed anything for the C64 for over 30 years, and that was at the level of bouncing balls, repeating my name and painstakingly failing to enter code I didn’t understand from magazines.

I am intrigued and slightly intimidated! Let’s go!
