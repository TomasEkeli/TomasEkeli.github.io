This site is owned and operated by Tomas Ekeli. I am a software developer, and I write about things that interest me. If you are interested in contacting me: my socials are in the footer of this page, or reach out by e-mail. My e-mail address is my first name at this domain without the www.

## About the site

This site is 100% static files served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the [source code](https://github.com/TomasEkeli/TomasEkeli.github.io/) is available on GitHub.

## Personal data and tracking

There is no tracking on this site, and it does not collect your data, personal or otherwise. I have no interest in tracking you. If you want to leave a trace or comment, you can do so by e-mail or on my socials. I have absolutely no idea who you are and how often you've been here. Feels nice, doesn't it?

Since site is hosted by GitHub Pages, and they specify that they [collect visitors' IP-addresses for "security purposes"](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages#data-collection) your IP will probably be in their logs. I have no control over this, and I do not know what they do with the data. You can read more in [GitHub's privacy statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

If you want to hide your IP-address you should probably use a VPN or Tor. I do not endorse any particular VPN or Tor, but I might use them myself.

## Technology

This site is generated from [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) -files by [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) using a slightly modified version of the base Jekyll theme, [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). You can find out more info about customizing Jekyll themes, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
