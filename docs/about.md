This site is owned and operated by Tomas Ekeli. I am a software developer, and I write about things that interest me. If you are interested in contacting me: my socials are in the footer of this page, or reach out by e-mail. My e-mail address is my first name at this domain without the www.

## About the site

This site is 100% static files served by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The site is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and the [source code](https://github.com/TomasEkeli/TomasEkeli.github.io/) is available on GitHub.

There is no tracking on this site, and it does not collect your data, personal or otherwise. Well, I don't actually know that since I don't host it, but there is no tracking by me, and I have no interest in tracking you.

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
