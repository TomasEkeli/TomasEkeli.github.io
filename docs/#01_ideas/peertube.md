Videos on the internet make me think of a few big names. There's YouTube, of course. Also TikTok, SnapChat, Vine (is that still a thing?), Vimeo...

But all of these are sites where people can post their videos and reach an audience "owned" by the site. You only have access to your audience through YouTube, and they only get to see your content through YouTube. Sure, you can post it on other sites as well, but that's just double-dipping into the few, big walled-gardens.

PeerTube is different. Instead of one company with a site where you upload there are many smaller sites all running the same software.

What's so special about that? That's just a lot of tiny walled-gardens. If you're going to be inside a gated community, it had better be a pretty nice and big one, right?

Well, PeerTube doesn't do the "walled" -part of the garden. When someone starts up a new site running the software they are not building a fence around a new plot of land - they are adding their little plot onto the big plot that is all of the other PeerTube servers.

Sure, they can lock their plot off, if they want, make their own fence if you like, but that's not what people usually do.

So - as soon as you put a video on PeerTube it is available through thousands of sites - all linked back to the site where it lives.

How is that good? How do I get paid for that?

You don't, particularly, get paid for that. What it does give you is access to an audience, but you still have to make good content. There's no single site that gathers advertisement revenue from the views of your video and shares a pittance of that with you (if you don't happen to get "demonetized"). So, what do you get?

The Fediverse is amazing. It is what the web was supposed to be.
